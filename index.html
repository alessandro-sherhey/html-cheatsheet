        <p>
            This website contains the most important tags you need while writing HTML code. Every tag is inside a card, to possibly make
            things easier to find and understand.

        <div class="container">
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tells the browser that you're writing an HTML 5 code. If you don't put this line of code the browser
                    will guess the version. As you can imagine it often works, but if it guesses the HTML version wrong your
                    website could be a mess!
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;html&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the first tag you have to write, after the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag of course.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;head&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the first tag that goes inside the &lt;html&gt; tag. Inside this you'll write all the website
                    metadata.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;body&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the <em>most important</em> tag. Here goes what will be shown on the browser!
                </p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <h2 id="textStuff">Headings and Text</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;h1&gt;</h3>
                <p>Headings can have 6 different tags. The first (this one) is the biggest heading while the last is the
                    smallest.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;h2&gt;</h3>
                <p>The second biggest tag.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;h3&gt;</h3>
                <p>The third biggest tag.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;h4&gt;</h3>
                <p>Now to the smaller headings: this is the third smallest tag.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;h5&gt;</h3>
                <p>The second smallest tag.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;h6&gt;</h3>
                <p>The smallest tag of all.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;p&gt;</h3>
                <p>As the name suggests, this tag makes a paragraph in the website.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="moreWidth">
                <h3>&lt;a&gt;</h3>
                <p> 
                    Instead this tag is used for links. Instead you'll add a href="" attribute for associating a link with what's 
                    inside the &lt;a&gt;. For example if you want to write a paragraph that makes the user go to another website
                    when clicked you need to write:<br>
                    &lt;a href="yourLink"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click here to go to another website!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br>
                    where yourLink is the link of the external website.
                </p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;strong&gt;</h3>
                <p>This tag makes text bold. <strong>Like this</strong>.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;em&gt;</h3>
                <p>This one makes text <em>italic</em>. "em" stays for emphasis.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;u&gt;</h3>
                <p>This gives text an <u>underline</u>.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;sub&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is for making text subscript. It can be useful to write scientific formulas. Like H<sub>2</sub>O.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;sup&gt;</h3>
                <p>And this is the opposite of subscript. It makes text <sup>superscript</sup>.</p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;ul&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is useful to make lists that don't necessarily need to have every element ordered. "ul" stands
                    for "Unordered List". It just adds a point to every element of the list, like:<br>
                    • Wake up<br>
                    • Eat<br>
                    • Go to sleep
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;ol&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag, instead of the previous one, makes ordered lists. The lists are by default ordered with numbers,
                    like:<br>
                    1. Wake up<br>
                    2. Eat<br>
                    3. Go to sleep<br>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;li&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is essential to add elements to lists. Every list item needs this tag. For example, the code for the
                    list shown before would be:<br>
                    &lt;ol&gt;<br>
                    &lt;li&gt;Wake up&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                    &lt;li&gt;Eat&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                    &lt;li&gt;Go to sleep&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/ol&gt;
                </p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;table&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This is where all the content of your table will go. However, this doesn't store the content itself. It serves
                    as a container where all the tags for the structure of the table will go, like rows and data.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;tr&gt;</h3>
                <p>This tag creates a table row, hence the name.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;td&gt;</h3>
                <p>This tag goes inside the &lt;td&gt; tag. Here is what will be displayed on the browser! "td" stands for Table Data.</p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <h2 id="advStructure">Advanced Structure and Attributes</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;div&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is used for grouping different elements together. It is really useful when writing CSS code for the website
                    since you can apply a single property for multiple elements, but that's not the only thing! You can do a lot more
                    things with divs!
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>id="..."</h3>
                <p>
                    This is an <strong>attribute</strong>. It gives an element a specific "name" of your choice, so you can identify it
                    easily when styling with CSS. <strong>Note: you can't give the same ID to more elements!</strong>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>class="..."</h3>
                <p>
                    This is another attribute that is used for identifying items. But this is different: unlike the id attribute, <strong>
                    the same class can be used for more elements!</strong>
                </p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <h2 id="semanticHTML">Semantic HTML</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Semantic HTML gives <strong>a meaning</strong> to the code we write. For example a div, which is a general purpose element,
            can be an &lt;article&gt;, a &lt;section&gt; an &lt;header&gt;, a &lt;footer&gt;, and much more!
        </p>
        <div class="container">
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;article&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is commonly used in blogs and posts. It means that the text inside it is not related to other parts of the website.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;nav&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, this is used for navigation bars, like the one on the top of the website!
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;header&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is instead used for... headers!
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;main&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    Inside this tag you'll write all the main content of the website.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;footer&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    And inside this one you'll write all the content of the footer.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;header&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is instead used for... headers!
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>&lt;section&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    This tag is used for various sections of content. Imagine if there was a simple website with a whole book in it. Every
                    chapter of the book could go inside the &lt;section&gt; tag!
